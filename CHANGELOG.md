# Changelog

All notable changes to `@todovue/tv-label` will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-15
### Changed
- Removed CSS injection at runtime via `vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js`.
- Styles are now served from separate CSS files generated by Vite (`dist/*.css`) and must be imported explicitly in the consuming app (SPA or Nuxt).
- Improved SSR/SSG compatibility, especially for Nuxt applications, by relying on standard CSS assets instead of runtime style injection.
